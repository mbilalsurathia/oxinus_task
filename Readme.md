The purpose of this task is to create a simple backend api with:
• CRUD endpoints for the following database schema(“Account”).
• User login endpoint with email and password authentication.
• List of accounts endpoint with result limitation through request.


So we created an NodeJs App where we can perform Crud operations for accounts
First we need to follow these steps to start an app.
1) Node installation
2) Postgres installation
3) Download this repo
4) run this command to install related packages ('cmd', '```npm install```') to download all the related packages
5) then run this command to start the project ('cmd', '```node app.js```')
    i) app.js is the main file to start the application and create a scheme named 'accounts'
6) Now Application is start you can perform cruds operation. (Adding postman collection also OXINUS.postman_collection)


If you want to create database locally you can use also ```database.sql``` file.
